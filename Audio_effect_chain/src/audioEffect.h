Weak_ptrs could help as they do not define ownership. However, having nodes owned by other nodes in a situation where you can have arbitrary and complex graph topologies (e.g. in Reaktor) may get very difficult to manage. Instead, using two vectors of simple pointers in each node, one for inputs and one for outputs, and then having a managing class (effectChain in this case) which owns the nodes and manages the graph using an adjacency list or matrix, and handles adding/deleting nodes, detecting feedback loops, walking the graph, etc,  might lead to a cleaner and safer implementation. */
